# Bityard Datapack
## Bespoke datapack for the Bityard Minecraft server

### Disclaimer
This datapack is explicitly created and maintained for the Bityard Minecraft server. Use of this datapack outside of Bityard is not intended or supported and there is no guarantee that it will work in other Minecraft worlds. The datapack includes a wide variety of different functionality, overriding certain files in the minecraft namespace while adding several namespaces of its own for different features. As such it is unlikely to be compatible with any other datapack. In addition, certain functionality is hard-coded to work within particular in-game coordinates or dimensions and may have adverse affects on your world. Issue reports or feature requests related to use-cases explicitly outside of Bityard will not be recognized.

### Setup
The Bityard Datapack uses a range of scoreboard objectives to track player, entity and global values. 
These objectives can be easily setup by running: `/function bityard:setup_all`
